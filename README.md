How to Work

1. Get Back-end running 
- `cd api`
- `python app.py`
- *note that there are some dependencies required to get this working so you might need to pip install the dependecies*
- should be good to go! If you have troubles or want to ensure this is working you can run a curl command detailed in `api/README.md`

2. Start the front-end
- `cd photo_app`
- `npm start`
